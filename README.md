# mutant-dna
Hey ! Wanted to say thanks for the nice challenge and this repo is to walk you guys around the "solution".

So tbh I don't have much of a time so, I'll make small steps day by day on this, and hopefully I can finish in time. 

# Step 1

I've included CRA so we can have a local server, and hopefully a UI where we can run the tests.

# Step 2

Decided to move to a MERN stack to be able to POST a new mutant and GET the records keeping in mind all the 3 lvls we want to solve (analyze dna, have an endpoint, and creating a DB), I've included other handy libs to make life easier, and I'll try to do more commits so we can see the process and making of :)

I remember this stack cause I read about it and work with it in some proyects but is the second(?) time I fully create one from scratch.

# Step 3

Created a function to check horizontal strings for the desired pattern, but realize that if the matrix will be NxN like the exercise says, we can. use it to check vertically as well, (that's next step)
