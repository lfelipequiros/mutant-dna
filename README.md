# mutant-dna
Hey ! Wanted to say thanks for the nice challenge and this repo is to walk you guys around the "solution".

So tbh I don't have much of a time so, I'll make small steps day by day on this, and hopefully I can finish in time. 

# Step 1

I've included CRA so we can have a local server, and hopefully a UI where we can run the tests.

# Step 2

Decided to move to a MERN stack to be able to POST a new mutant and GET the records keeping in mind all the 3 lvls we want to solve (analyze dna, have an endpoint, and creating a DB), I've included other handy libs to make life easier, and I'll try to do more commits so we can see the process and making of :)

I remember this stack cause I read about it and work with it in some proyects but is the second(?) time I fully create one from scratch.
